To make an antsim:

* Simulation
    * Lets use pixels - array of.
    * They can contain stuff - pheromone, obstacle, food. Food has a value - that is consumed. Pheromone degrades if not present.
    * pheromone will drift to adjacent squares if its above a threshold.
    * Food -> up to 255.
    * Pheromone -> Up to 255. 
    * Drift value -> Up to 9 -> degrading is a dispersal, so looses 8 units, and 8 surrounding squares get pheromone + 1 (unless they have a higher value already).
        * At each tick, if a square has less than 8the number of empty pheromons squares around it, it just looses 1 pheronmone.
    * Ant's cannot move into an obstacle square. They can take up to 20 units of food.
    * One pixel is home.
* Ant
    * Consumes a food unit per movement.
    * Died if at 0.
    * Can hold up to 100 food.
    * Leaves a pheromone trail when moving -> 
        * Nest to Food (last touched the nest)
        * Food to nest (last touched the food source)
        These two are independant. It leaves a trail with strength 32 (4 x 8 so allows for some dispersion.)
        It will track these pheromones in front of it if it's found them.
    * Will wander randomly if no food -> moving in a direction, sometimes changing direction, mostly forward.
        * Forced to turn randomly at an obstacle.
        * Will turn towards a square with the most pheromone from the current square. But may randomly not.
            * Follow food trail when it has food too.
            * Follow the without food trail when empty.

* Nest starts with 100 ants.
* When food gets back to the nest then +1 ant for 20 food (up to 100 ants). Ant keeps the rest of the food for it's wanderings.
* An ant with less than 50 
* Save ->
    * Save the state of the world, and the state of the 100 ants.

Explore mode: Go to places without pheremone while food > 50. Leaving to nest pheromone. If we find nest to food pheremone, 
    switch to hungry mode.
Hungry mode: Follow from nest to food pheromone. (food <50). Leaving more of the nest to food pheremone.
Return mode: Follow to nest when food has been found. Leaving to food pheromone.
When been to nest: switch to hungry or explore depending on food remaining.
